# Android python interpreter using cmake build system
Based on python-for-android

### Requirements
To compile this project you'll need: <br/><br/>
Android NDK <br/>
Crystax NDK [download](https://www.crystax.net/en/download)

### Crystax NDK
P4A uses CrystaxSDK to compile Python3. CrystaxSDK is open source. 
Crystax is a US company founded in 2012. The SDK has been developed as a drop-in replacement for Google’s Android NDK (Native Development 
Kit). Compared to Google’s NDK, the CrystaX NDK provides the same functionality as well as several great features and tons of fixes and improvements.

### Build systems
Android has 3 build systems. The old build system based on Android.mk. 
The CMake build system (current, from Android Studio 2.2 [link](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cmake.html)) 
and the gradle-experimental build system (future [link](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental#TOC-Latest-Version) ).
